# Introduction

An example of how to integrate [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) into an Angular 4.x application by [Richard Natal - Bigous](https://github.com/Bigous) and [Dave Skender - madcalfus](https://github.com/madcalfus)

Project setup based [angular-seed](https://github.com/mgechev/angular-seed.git)

# How to start

**Note** that this seed project requires node v4.x.x or higher and npm 2.14.7 but in order to be able to take advantage of the complete functionality we **strongly recommend node >=v6.5.0 and npm >=3.10.3**.  It also works with NPM 5.x

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AngularShowcase/angular2-seed-ng2-highcharts.git
cd angular2-seed-ng2-highcharts
npm install       # or `npm run reinstall` if you get an error
npm start         # start with --env dev
```
